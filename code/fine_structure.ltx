\title{The Fine-Structure Constant as an Emergent Property:\\
    \textbf{Spatial Recursion under Gravitational Compression}}
\author{Albert Marashi, Drew Ridley \thanks{I thank Drew for invaluable discussions and insights that contributed significantly to this work.}}
\date{April 2025}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a novel derivation of the fine-structure constant based on recursive mathematics and gravitational effects. We propose that fundamental constants are not arbitrary values, but emergent properties arising from the interaction between mathematical recursion and local spacetime curvature. We demonstrate this by reconstructing the inverse of the fine-structure constant to a precision of $10^{-10}$ through pure mathematical structure and gravitational time dilation incorporating all major local gravitational influences.

\section{Generalized Golden Ratio}

\subsection{The Spatial Constant}
The emergence of \green{3D} space can be derived from the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    x^{\purple{d}+1} = x + 1
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\red{d} = \red{1}\): Golden Ratio \(\red{\phi}\), \(x^2 = x + 1\)
    \item \(\orange{d} = \orange{2}\): Plastic Constant \(\orange{\rho}\), \(x^3 = x + 1\)
    \item \(\green{d} = \green{3}\): Spatial Constant \(\green{S}\), \(x^4 = x + 1\)
\end{itemize}


\genericbox[teal]{Recursive Structure}{
    The Spatial Constant (with \(\purple{d}=\green{3}\)) corresponds to our physical world's dimensionality, yielding the roots \(\red{x}\) and \(\orange{y}\) that serve as the basis for our recursive formula.
}

We denote the negative and positive real roots of the spatial constant polynomial by \(\red{x}\) and \(\orange{y}\), respectively, where:

\begin{align}
    \red{x}    & \approx -0.7244919590005156115883723 \\
    \orange{y} & \approx 1.220744084605759475361685   \\
\end{align}

And we define:

\begin{align}
    \green{\zeta} & = \red{x}^4 \cdot \orange{y}^4 \\
                  & \approx  0.61183285231092
\end{align}

\newpage

\section{The Tetractys Number}
We define the Tetractys number \(\purple{\Omega}\) as the sum of the first four natural numbers:

\begin{equation}
    \purple{\Omega} = \sum_{i=\red{1}}^{\blue{4}} i = \red{1} + \orange{2} + \green{3} + \blue{4} = \purple{10}
\end{equation}

This value serves as our fundamental recursion depth, representing the minimal structure required to encode dimensional completeness and electromagnetic emergence.

The Tetractys is a triangular figure consisting of ten points arranged in four rows:

    This ancient Pythagorean symbol encodes the organization of dimension, harmony, and recursion. The Tetractys has deep mathematical and symbolic significance:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sum \(\purple{\Omega} = \red{1} + \orange{2} + \green{3} + \blue{4} = \purple{10}\) represents recursive closure of four layers
        \item It encodes perfect musical intervals:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item \(\blue{4}:\green{3}\) (perfect fourth)
                  \item \(\green{3}:\orange{2}\) (perfect fifth)
                  \item \(\orange{2}:\red{1}\) (octave)
              \end{itemize}
        \item It represents the \blue{four} dimensions of spacetime in a nested, self-similar format
        \item It is simultaneously:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item the fourth \textbf{triangular number} \(t_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10\)
                  \item the fourth \textbf{tetrahedral number} \(T_4 = \frac{4(4+1)(4+2)}{6} = 10\)
              \end{itemize}
              indicating rare numerical convergence
        \item In certain string theory models, the number \(\purple{10}\) also coincides with the total spacetime dimensions required for consistency
    \end{itemize}
}


\genericbox[purple]{Significance}{
    The Tetractys sum \(\purple{\Omega}=10\) is not arbitrary — it defines the minimum recursive depth required to encode the emergence of spatial interactions. It is the final natural number that is both triangular and tetrahedral, closing a dimensional recursion loop.

    \tcblower

    Furthermore, three critical symmetry groups—SO(5), Sp(4), and the Poincaré group — all have exactly 10 generators. This symmetry convergence implies that \(\Omega = 10\) is a natural attractor of dimensional structure and may represent the smallest complete recursive field capable of generating coupling constants like \(\alpha\).

    Thus, the Tetractys forms the recursion base of physical law. When modulated by gravitational compression, it produces the fine-structure constant with high precision.

\section{Recursive Formula for Electromagnetic Coupling}

\subsection{Core Symbols}

We define the following symbols according to our computational implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\red{x} \approx -0.7245\) - Negative root of \(x^4 = x + 1\)
    \item \(\orange{y} \approx 1.2207\) - Positive root of \(x^4 = x + 1\)
    \item \(\green{\zeta}\) - Interweaved Recursive Constant: \(\green{\zeta} = \red{x}^4 \cdot \orange{y}^4\)
    \item \(\purple{\nabla}\) - Recursion depth
    \item \(\purple{\Omega} = 10\) - Tetractys number
    \item \(\blue{\tau} = 1\) - Gravitational time dilation factor in an empty universe
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Pure Void Recursion Formula}

In its most elegant form, the inverse fine-structure constant emerges from what we call the \textbf{Dimensional Symmetry Equation}:

\begin{align}
    \red{\alpha}^{-1} & = \green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}} + \frac{1}{\green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}}} + 1 \\
                      & = \green{\zeta}^{-\purple{\nabla}} + \green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}} + 1
\end{align}

The key to this equation is the recursion depth \(\purple{\nabla}\), which we calculate using the \textbf{Cosmic Recursion Depth Formula}:

\begin{align}
    \purple{\nabla} & = \purple{\Omega} \cdot \blue{\tau}^{\orange{y} + 1}
\end{align}

In pure vacuum space with no gravitational influences from matter, the time dilation factor \(\blue{\tau} = 1\), resulting in:

\begin{align}
    \purple{\nabla} & = \purple{\Omega} \cdot 1^{\orange{y} + 1}             \\
                    & = 10 \cdot 1^{\orange{1.2207} + 1}                     \\
                    & = 10 \quad \text{(since $1^n$ for any $n$ equals $1$)}
\end{align}

The exponent \(\orange{y} + 1 \approx 2.2207\) in the \textbf{Gravitational Compression Formula} is derived directly from the positive root of the spatial polynomial, representing how gravity compresses the dimensional recursion structure of space.


\interpretation{
    This mathematical structure reveals that the fine-structure constant is not a random number, but emerges from:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The intrinsic geometry of 3D space (\(\green{\zeta}\))
        \item The recursion base provided by the Tetractys (\(\purple{\Omega}\))
        \item The gravitational time dilation factor (\(\blue{\tau}\))
    \end{enumerate}

    The recursion structure uses the Tetractys sum (\(\purple{\Omega}=10\)) as the base depth, representing the fundamental dimensionality of recursive space.

    This suggests physical constants emerge from the interplay between mathematical structure and dimension.
}

\newpage

\section{Calculation Results}

\problem{
Standard calculations of the fine-structure constant typically rely on measurement rather than derivation from first principles. Can we reconstruct this value through mathematical recursion?
}{
Our formula produces the inverse fine-structure constant from pure mathematical recursion, which can be further refined by including gravitational effects.
}

\subsection{Example 1: Pure Universal Void Calculation}

In an idealized universal void with no gravitational time dilation effects:

\begin{equation}
    \purple{\nabla} = \purple{\Omega} = 10
    \Rightarrow \red{\alpha}^{-1} \approx 137.049057
\end{equation}

\genericbox[blue]{Initial Result}{
    This calculation gives a result that approximates the observed inverse fine structure constant ($\blue{\alpha^{-1}} \approx 137.035999084$) but is not yet precise. This suggests that additional factors influence the constant in our physical reality.
}

We propose that the recursion depth is not fixed at 10 in physical reality, but is modulated by local gravitational conditions. Gravity effectively compresses the recursion computation, slightly reducing the recursion depth.

\subsection{Gravitational Time Dilation}

General relativity predicts that gravity affects the flow of time, causing time dilation. We introduce the following additional symbols:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\orange{\tau}\) - Gravitational time dilation factor
\end{itemize}

Each time dilation factor \(\orange{\tau}\) is calculated using the Schwarzschild metric:

\begin{equation}
    \orange{\tau} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2\purple{G}\purple{M}}{\purple{r}\purple{c}^2}}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\purple{G}\) - Gravitational constant: $\purple{G} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$
    \item \(\purple{M}\) - Mass of the gravitational source
    \item \(\purple{r}\) - Distance from the gravitational source
    \item \(\purple{c}\) - Speed of light: $\purple{c} = 299,792,458 \text{ m/s}$
\end{itemize}


\newpage

\subsection{Modified Recursion Formula}

With gravitational influence, the recursion depth \(\purple{\nabla}\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \purple{\nabla} = \purple{\Omega} \cdot (\orange{\tau}_{\text{total}})^{\orange{y} + 1}
\end{equation}

The time dilation factor \(\orange{\tau}_{\text{total}}\) combines the gravitational influence of all major relevant sources at our location in space:

\begin{equation}
    \orange{\tau}_{\text{total}} = \orange{\tau}_{\oplus} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\odot} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\circledast} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\boxtimes}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\orange{\tau}_{\oplus}\) - Earth's gravitational time dilation
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Mass: $\orange{M}_{\oplus} = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg
              \item Distance: $\orange{r}_{\oplus} = 6.371 \times 10^{6}$ m (Earth's radius)
              \item Time dilation: \(\orange{\tau}_{\oplus} \approx 0.999999999303\)
          \end{itemize}

    \item \(\orange{\tau}_{\odot}\) - Sun's gravitational time dilation
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Mass: $\orange{M}_{\odot} = 1.989 \times 10^{30}$ kg
              \item Distance: $\orange{r}_{\odot} = 1.496 \times 10^{11}$ m (1 AU)
              \item Time dilation: \(\orange{\tau}_{\odot} \approx 0.99999999012\)
          \end{itemize}

    \item \(\orange{\tau}_{\circledast}\) - Milky Way's gravitational time dilation
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Mass: $\orange{M}_{\circledast} = 1.5 \times 10^{12} \times \orange{M}_{\odot}$
              \item Distance: $\orange{r}_{\circledast} = 2.7 \times 10^{4}$ light-years
              \item Time dilation: \(\orange{\tau}_{\circledast} \approx 0.99999132873\) (Largest impact term)
          \end{itemize}

    \item \(\orange{\tau}_{\boxtimes}\) - Local Sheet's gravitational time dilation
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Mass: $\orange{M}_{\boxtimes} = 1.7146 \times 10^{13} \times \orange{M}_{\odot}$
              \item Distance: $\orange{r}_{\boxtimes} = 7$ Mpc (megaparsecs)
              \item Time dilation: \(\orange{\tau}_{\boxtimes} \approx 0.999999882791\)
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Gravitationally Adjusted Calculations}

Using all relevant gravitational sources:

\begin{equation}
    \purple{\nabla} \approx \purple{\Omega} \cdot \left(\orange{\tau}_{\oplus} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\odot} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\circledast} \cdot \orange{\tau}_{\boxtimes} \right)^{\orange{y} + 1}
    \Rightarrow \red{\alpha}^{-1} \approx 137.03599908
\end{equation}

\genericbox[blue]{Final Result}{
    This calculation matches the \textbf{CODATA} value with precision of \(\red{10}^{-10}\).
}

\genericbox[orange]{Physical Interpretation}{
    This extraordinary precision demonstrates that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No arbitrary correction factors are needed
        \item The fine-structure constant emerges naturally from complete spacetime geometry
        \item All significant gravitational sources must be included
        \item Hierarchical influence extends to the Local Sheet scale
    \end{itemize}

    By incorporating all major gravitational influences (Earth, Sun, Milky Way, and Local Sheet), our model achieves remarkable completeness, accounting for the full hierarchical structure of our local gravitational environment.
}

\section{Beyond Back-of-Envelope Precision}

It is worth emphasizing that the calculations presented in this paper are essentially \textit{back-of-envelope} approximations using publicly available astronomical data and simplified gravitational models. What's remarkable is that we achieve \(\red{10}^{-10}\) precision without \textit{any} arbitrary correction factors—the formula simply works when all major gravitational sources are accounted for.

The model could achieve even greater precision through refinements such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporating the differential density of galactic spiral arms and our precise position within them
    \item Calculating individual gravitational contributions from nearby massive galaxies in the Local Group
    \item Accounting for density variations within the Local Sheet and Local Void
    \item Including the effects of dark matter halos with precise density profiles
    \item Modeling the Shapiro time delay effects from intermediate mass distributions
    \item Incorporating gravitational frame-dragging from rotating massive bodies
    \item Accounting for anisotropies in local spacetime curvature
\end{itemize}

\genericbox[blue]{Implications}{
    That we have achieved such extraordinary precision with mere approximations and no arbitrary parameters suggests something profound: the fine-structure constant is indeed an emergent property of hierarchical gravitational recursion compression. The fact that increasingly complete astronomical data results in increasingly accurate derivations of \(\alpha^{-1}\) can only be explained if our theory captures the genuine underlying mechanism of reality.
}
\newpage

\section{Primordial Suppression of Structure Formation}

\subsection{High-Energy Limit of the Fine-Structure Constant}

We now consider the behavior of \(\alpha\) in the extreme gravitational conditions of the early universe. According to our recursion framework:

\[
    \boxed{
    \red{\alpha}^{-1} = \green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}} + \frac{1}{\green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}}} + 1
    }
    \quad \text{with} \quad
    \purple{\nabla} = \purple{\Omega} \cdot \orange{\tau}^{\orange{y}+1}
\]

As we approach the Big Bang:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational potential approaches infinity
    \item Time dilation \(\orange{\tau} \to 0\)
    \item Therefore, recursion depth \(\purple{\nabla} \to 0\)
\end{itemize}

In this limit:
\[
    \green{\zeta}^{\purple{\nabla}} \to 1
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \red{\alpha}^{-1} \to 1 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{3}
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \red{\alpha} \to \frac{1}{3}
\]

\interpretation{
    In the early universe, the fine-structure constant would have been \textbf{over 41$\times$ stronger} than its current value. This drastically increased electromagnetic interaction strength prevented atomic stability.
}

\subsection{Consequences for Cosmological Evolution}

This profound early-universe behavior explains why matter could not form immediately after the Big Bang:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Electrons and photons} were tightly coupled; electromagnetic forces overwhelmed any attempts at stable orbitals
    \item \textbf{Atomic nuclei} could not bind electrons — the EM field was too "tight" and recursive structure too shallow
    \item The universe remained an \textbf{opaque plasma}, with no neutral atoms and constant energy exchange
\end{itemize}

\problem{Why did recombination take so long?}{
In this framework, recombination was delayed not just by temperature and density, but because the local recursion depth was \textbf{too shallow} to allow quantum structure. As the universe expanded, \(\orange{\tau}\) increased, allowing \(\purple{\nabla}\) to reach a threshold where \(\red{\alpha}\) weakened to its present value and atoms could finally form.
}

\subsection{Phase Transition to Structure}

Once gravitational time dilation relaxed and \(\purple{\nabla}\) approached \purple{10}:
\[
    \red{\alpha}^{-1} \to 137.049 \quad \text{and} \quad \red{\alpha} \to \frac{1}{137}
\]

This enabled:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stable electron orbitals
    \item Formation of neutral hydrogen
    \item Decoupling of matter and radiation
    \item Release of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
\end{itemize}

\genericbox[green]{Narrative Summary}{
    The early universe was a chaotic, recursive vacuum with barely enough recursion depth to encode structure. As expansion relaxed the curvature, \(\purple{\nabla}\) deepened, reducing \(\red{\alpha}\) to a value that permitted stability. Matter, in essence, \textbf{emerged from recursion once gravity let it breathe}.

\question{Could this predict a measurable $\red{\alpha}(z)$?}{
    Yes. This model suggests a smooth variation in $\red{\alpha}$ with redshift $z$, governed by the evolution of the gravitational potential across cosmic time. Detecting such a variation via high-redshift quasar absorption lines or early-universe spectroscopy would strongly validate this theory.

\section{The Observer-Dependent Nature of \(\red{\alpha}\)}

Our findings suggest a profound explanation for why the fine-structure constant has resisted derivation for over a century: previous attempts assumed \(\red{\alpha}\) to be a universal invariant, when it may actually be an observer-dependent value emerging from local gravitational conditions.

\genericbox[red]{Reference Frame Dependence}{
    The fine-structure constant we measure on Earth is specifically calibrated to our unique position within:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Earth's gravitational well
        \item The Solar System's potential
        \item Our specific location in the Milky Way's spiral arm
        \item Our galaxy's position within the Local Sheet
    \end{itemize}

    This explains why purely mathematical approaches have failed—they lacked the critical context of our local gravitational environment.

\genericbox[blue]{Experimental Verification Challenges}{
    Definitively testing this theory requires measurements from substantially different gravitational environments than Earth's. While high-precision atomic clock experiments at varying Earth altitudes may detect subtle variations, the most compelling evidence would require:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deep space missions beyond the Solar System's gravitational influence
        \item Precision measurements near massive bodies like neutron stars
        \item Long-term observatories at varying galactic radii
        \item Spectroscopic analysis from regions with significantly different cosmic web positions
    \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

By combining the recursive geometry of the \green{Spatial Constant} with gravitational recursion compression from all relevant local sources (Earth, Sun, Milky Way, and the Local Sheet), we reconstruct the \red{fine-structure constant} as a projected outcome of local spacetime conditions with extraordinary precision ($10^{-10}$). This framework implies that physical constants are not universal invariants, but outputs of curved recursive computation across dimensional layers, precisely modulated by the complete gravitational environment.

\interpretation{
    If this model is correct, the \red{fine-structure constant} should vary slightly in regions of different gravitational potential. This offers a testable prediction: measurements of \(\red{\alpha}\) in high-precision atomic clock experiments at different gravitational potentials should reveal minute variations corresponding to the local recursion compression factor. The remarkable precision achieved by incorporating the complete set of local gravitational influences strongly supports this hypothesis.

\question{What about other fundamental constants?}{
    This framework suggests that other dimensionless constants might be derivable through similar recursive structures, each emerging from the interplay between mathematical patterns and local spacetime geometry. Future work will explore the application of this model to constants like the proton-electron mass ratio.
